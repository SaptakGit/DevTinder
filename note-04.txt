Order of route matter a lot
Install Postman
    -> create Workspace
    -> create Collections

app.use => This will match all the HTTP method API calls

Advanced Routing:
        app.get("/ab?c") => ? Makes it optional. It will work for /ac and /abc both
        app.get("/ab+c") => + Makes it allow multiple 'b'. 
                            It will work for /ac and /abbbbbbc both
        app.get("/ab*cd") => * Makes it allow anythig in between optional. 
                            It will work for /abcd and /ab'ANYTHING IN BETWEEN'cd both
        app.get("/a(bc)?d") => () Makes it group optional. It will work for /ac and /abcd both
        app.get("/a(bc)+cd") => + Makes it allow multiple 'b'. 
                            It will work for /ac and /abcbcbcd both
        Regex Also work:
            app.get("/a/") => If any 'a' comes on the url it will work.
            app.get("/.*fly$/") => If  that starts with anythig and ends with 'fly' it will work.

        http://localhost:7777/user?userId=101&password=test =>
            console.log(req.query);
        http://localhost:7777/user/101 =>
            app.get("/user/:userId/:name/:password"), (req, res) => {
                console.log(req.params);
                res.send({"firstname": "Saptak", "lastname" : "Das"})
            });
