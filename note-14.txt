User Feed API
    /user/Feed

    ignored profile should not come
    interested sent by own, those profile should not come
    connected profile should not come
    own profile should not come

    Basically if these profiles are in the 'ConnectionRequest' Table by any status, they should not come to each other feed.

    select in mongoose ->
    const connectionRequests = await ConnectionRequest.find({
            $or:[
                {fromUserId: loggedInUser._id},
                {toUserId: loggedInUser._id}
            ],
        }).select("fromUserId toUserId");

    Using Set() to store unique id's which are already in my ConnectionRequest.

    $nin => Not in
    $ne => Not Equal To
